# generics-exercises

This repo contains some demonstrations of generic types and functions and how to use them.

Code intended for demo purposes only, not production-ready.

## How to use

Start by commenting out most of the content in `main.go`.

Uncomment each line starting with `fmt.Printf(...` one-by-one, along with any code preceding each
statement. Make sure you understand the concepts introduced in each example before movind on to 
the next one.

Some lines don't compile. If there's a comment mentioning that it won't compile,
read the error from the compiler and try to understand it. Otherwise, make the
code changes necessary for it to compile and keep going.
